TutoExplainTitle=Measure Activity
TutoExplainContent=Welcome into the Measure activity. This activity is an activity to learn the concepts of sound.
TutoTimeFreqTitle=Time and Frequency Domain
TutoTimeFreqContent=It draws a graph of microphone input versus time or frequency, the input is on the vertical axis and time or frequency is on the horizontal axis. You can switch between time and frequency modes by simply clicking this button.Try by speaking something!
TutoZoomSettingsTitle=Zoom Settings
TutoZoomSettingsContent=You can increase or decrease scale of time and frequency either by using sliders or buttons. Scale means time and frequency corresponding to 1 division.
TutoPlayPauseTitle=Play or Pause
TutoPlayPauseContent=You can play or pause plotting of graph using this button. Tap this button to switch between play and pause mode.
TutoAmplitudeTitle=Increase or decrease amplitude
TutoAmplitudeContent=You can increase or decrease amplitude of waveform using sliders and buttons. You may confuse between zoom and amplitude. In simple terms, zoom works in horizontal direction where as amplitude works in vertical direction.
TutoWaveformInversionTitle=Waveform Inversion
TutoWaveformInversionContent=Inversion means taking mirror image of waveform about y equals to 0 line. You can change between normal and invert waveform by pressing this button. Status of waveform (i.e inverted/normal) is displayed on right hand side. It only works in time mode.
TutoTriggeringEdgeTitle=Triggering Edge
TutoTriggeringEdgeContent=It has three modes namely None, Rising Edge and Falling Edge. In Rising Edge mode, waveform is shifted such that starting waveform edge on left hand side is rising i.e its value increases in positive direction. Similarly in Falling mode, waveform is shifted such that starting edge value increases in negative direction. In None mode, waveform is not shifted. You can switch between different modes by pressing this button. It only works in time mode.
TutoLoggingExplainTitle=About Logging
TutoLoggingExplainContent=Logging means recording amplitude of time or frequency (whichever mode selected) at an interval selected by user. If user selected log interval as 1 second, then on start of recording, amplitude of time or frequency mode will be recorded at an interval of 1 second. This log can be exported later into CSV or PDF format later.
TutoLoggingIntervalTitle=Logging Interval
TutoLoggingIntervalContent=It is the interval after which amplitude of time or frequency is recorded on start of recording.
TutoStartStopTitle=Start or stop Recording
TutoStartStopContent=You can start or stop recording of amplitude by pressing this button. Amplitude of time or frequency will be recorded at the selected logging interval.
TutoExportLoggingTitle=Export log data
TutoExportLoggingContent=You can export recorded log data in PDF and CSV format by clicking this button.
TutoInstrumentExplainTitle=About Instrument Tuning
TutoInstrumentExplainContent=In order to tune an instrument, for example, a guitar, select instrument from palette. You will then see a set of vertical lines corresponding to the base frequency of each note for a tuned instrument. When tapping a string, the corresponding peak should be centered at the reference line. If this does not happen, tighten or loose the string until achieving it. Play note feature is included in tuning palette that will play the reference frequency.
TutoInstrumentSelectTitle=Select Instrument
TutoInstrumentSelectContent=You can select instrument you want to tune from the given list of instruments.
TutoNoteSelectTitle=Select Note
TutoNoteSelectContent=This palette shows list of all notes of selected instrument. Every note has different color. Note is present in same color in graph as that in palette.
TutoOctaveSelectTitle=Select Octave
TutoOctaveSelectContent=This palette shows list of octave. It is only visible when no instrument is selected. Frequency corresponding to combination of selected note and octave will be displayed in tuning input field in next palette.
TutoShowHarmonicsTitle=Show or hide harmonics
TutoShowHarmonicsContent=You can on or off display of harmonic lines by pressing this button. Harmonic lines will only display if both instrument and frequency mode is selected. Lines are of same color as of note.
TutoTuningFreqInputTitle=Tuning Frequency Input
TutoTuningFreqInputContent=It shows frequency of combination of note and octave when no instrument is selected. You can enter frequency value in this input field.
TutoTuningLineTitle=Show or hide tuning line
TutoTuningLineContent=Tuning line will be displayed at the same frequency as present in input field. You can show or hide tuning line by pressing this button. Along with tuning line, note and octave corresponding to highest input frequency will also be displayed on right corner of canvas.
TutoPlayStopNoteTitle=Play or Stop Note
TutoPlayStopNoteContent=You can play or stop note by pressing this button. Note will be played at frequency equal to frequency entered in input field.
TutoCaptureWaveformTitle=Capture Waveform
TutoCaptureWaveformContent=You can take screenshot of waveform by pressing this button. Screenshot will be saved in journal.
